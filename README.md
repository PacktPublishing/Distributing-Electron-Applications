## About the Video Course
Nowadays, security plays an important part in securing your system or data. With over 750 automation modules Ansible makes it easy for you to secure any part of your system, including setting firewalls, providing authentication to users and groups, and setting custom security policies. Ansible allows you to write automation procedures once and use them across your entire infrastructure. 
Electron is a popular open source framework that allows you to build desktop applications using the skills you already possess as a front-end developer.
In this course, we'll go through detailed discussions on how to properly package, sign, and distribute Electron applications. We'll start by quickly explaining how Electron applications are packaged under the hood, and armed with that knowledge, we'll cover every single major operating system in detail by using tools that automate the whole process.
Desktop application deployment is not a trivial task, and you might feel lost coming from a web development background. This course will help you navigate the sea of desktop application distribution by teaching you best practices, answering common concerns, and explaining in detail how to delegate application packaging and deployment to continuous integration services, so you can deploy a version of your application to all operating systems with a single command
